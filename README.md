# ![Logo](./docs/logo.ico) A Clone of Google Keep

A minimal *clone* of [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com) written in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) with [Material UI Components](https://material-ui.com/). This repo contains the the frontend application, please refer [backend API](https://github.com/HaswinVidanage/keep-clone-be) written in [Golang](https://golang.org/) with [GqlGen](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen). This project is created as a personal project with the intention of introducing complex features like sharing, collaborating notes and reminders etc in the future and focusing mostly on the backend implementation. In order for me to save time the frontend application of this project is heavily inspired by the [Google keep clone](https://github.com/anselm94/googlekeepclone.git) project and uses components from it. Please do check it out.
